# objectDetection

Here, we are building a real-time object detection application on Android: **Speak EyE**.

Speak EyE is an android application geared towards visually impaired individuals that can describe their surrounds and also provide some alerts.

# Navigation Folders

**SpeakEye**:     Our android application

**python_test**:  Folder for python based object detection tests

**cpp_test**:     Folder for C++ based object detection tests

**models**:       Where you should save your .pb models :)

The models can be downloaded from: [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
