# objectDetection

Here, we are building a real-time object detection application on Android: **Speak EyE**.

Speak EyE is an android application geared towards visually impaired individuals that can describe their surrounds and also provide some alerts.

# Navigation Folders

**SpeakEye**:     Our original android application

**python_test**:  Folder for python based object detection tests

**cpp_test**:     Folder for C++ based object detection tests

**models**:       Where you should save your .pb models :)

**Android**:      The new one for our android app, including object detection function. (And we are trying to integrate other                   functions to this app.)

The models can be downloaded from: [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)

# How to Run the App

1. Download our repository in Githup.

2. In Android Studio, click open and choose the corresponding app in the location where you download it.(like SpeakEyE or Android)

3. Run it in Android Studio.(You may need to get everything updated)

4. Choose the emulator and then you can see what we have done.
